The AI engineer successfully built an e-commerce website for security solutions, iteratively incorporating user feedback. Initial development focused on core e-commerce, contact forms, and a WhatsApp touchpoint. Subsequent iterations addressed UI/UX, particularly a banner carousel that initially had layout issues. A major phase involved building a comprehensive CMS Admin panel for product, content, and order management, deferring payment integrations. Critical fixes included installing missing Python dependencies (, ). Most recently, the engineer worked on SEO optimization, PWA features, improved video upload handling, and initiated a complex ERP/CRM system with SendGrid integration for automated email notifications, a significant undertaking still in progress. The development shows clear responsiveness to user demands and a systematic approach to feature addition and bug resolution.
