The AI engineer's work spanned several phases, starting with a basic e-commerce site and evolving into a complex system with a comprehensive admin panel and ERP/CRM features. Initial efforts focused on core e-commerce, contact forms, and a WhatsApp button. Subsequent iterations addressed UI/UX, including a dynamic banner carousel that had persistent display issues due to CORS and publishing logic. A significant portion of the work involved building out the CMS Admin panel for product, content, and order management, later expanding to include user management, site settings (logo, name), and an extensive ERP/CRM system. Critical fixes included resolving image/video upload paths, CORS issues, and ensuring publishing controls functioned correctly across content types. The most recent focus has been on delivering a Shopify-like admin experience, initiating a dashboard, page builder, and theme customizer, with initial files and dependencies set up.

The user requires a modern, aesthetically pleasing e-commerce website in Portuguese, selling security solutions. Initially, the goal was a core e-commerce site with product listings, a contact page, and a WhatsApp button. This expanded to include a comprehensive CMS Admin for managing products, shipping, stock, cart, and site content, with deferred payment integrations. Further enhancements included a dynamic home page banner carousel supporting images and videos with anti-copy protection, and robust SEO/PWA features. A major ongoing requirement is an integrated ERP/CRM system to manage monthly payments, equipment, maintenance, and contracts, alongside automated email (SendGrid) and manual WhatsApp notifications. More recently, the user demanded publishing control (draft/publish) for all admin-managed content (banners, products, pages) and dynamic control over site elements like the logo and site name. The ultimate goal is a Shopify-like admin for total site control, content creation, page editing, and order management.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing critical user feedback regarding persistent issues with images/logos not appearing on the site and duplicated admin menu icons. The engineer:
1.  **Fixed Admin Menu Icons**: Resolved repeated icons in  by assigning unique icons.
2.  **Resolved Image Display Issues**: Diagnosed that Kubernetes was serving  as HTML instead of images, leading to  errors.
    *   Created a new backend API route  in  to correctly serve images/videos.
    *   Updated the image upload endpoint to return URLs prefixed with .
    *   Updated all existing image/video URLs in the MongoDB database to use the new  prefix.
    *   The logo URL in  was also corrected to use the absolute .
This set of fixes aimed to ensure all media (logos, banners, product images) are served and displayed correctly. Visual testing confirmed the logo and banner video are now appearing.
